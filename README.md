# wtf-assets

This repo has two purposes:

  1. A place to record policies about how to run an instance of the "What They Forgot ..." (WTF) workshop, such as what to store where.
  1. Central storage for reusable workshop assets that don't fit into either of these locations:
    * Individual repos that contain, e.g., scaffolding for an activity or a completed activity.
    * An instructors-only syncable Drive or DropBox folder that contains, e.g., Keynote files.
