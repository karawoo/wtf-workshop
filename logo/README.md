About the WTF logo:

I made this inside Keynote, using Hex:

> Hex is a type-able three letter hexagonal monogram font.

Available from many places that distribute free fonts. Such as:

  * <https://www.dafont.com/hex.font>
  * <http://fonts101.com/fonts/view/Gothic/72428/Hex>

Important note about using Hex:

> It requires Discretionary Ligatures to be supported AND enabled to work 'out of the box', so please check the read me pdf for details of how to use it and for useful links to show you applications that support Open Type features it relies on to work (thanks Vinz).

I've included the aforementioned PDF here.

The "iwTf" in the upper right corner of the Keynote is the text you enter to produce the WTF logo, when you apply the Hex font.

I can't remember if I needed to do anything to get discretionary ligatures working.

We seem to have settled on "monograms" style (as opposed to "ornate"), with border 3.

2019-10-23 Anywhere the logo appears as a png or jpeg? For example, as a GitHub avatar. It has been done in a fairly primitive way. I exported the Keynote file to PNG, then manipulated in various low-tech ways. We should probably revisit this.
