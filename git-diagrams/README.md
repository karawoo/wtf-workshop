About the git diagrams:

These originated as diagrams made for the "Excuse me ..." article:

<https://github.com/dsscollection/git-github-for-stats>

I got many icons from here:

<http://www.iconsdb.com>

That lets you customize the hex color, once you've settled on an icon. And that is what the hex code in filenames refers to.

Helpful snippet for replacing the color in a logo obtained elsewhere:

```
convert Git-Logo-Black.png -fuzz 0% -fill '#544D47' -opaque '#000000' Git-Logo-544D47.png
```
